This page provides a comprehensive overview of the car data, allowing you to explore the various makes, models, sellers, and trims available in the dataset. 

Here, you can gain insights into:

* The types of cars being sold
* The distribution of models across different sellers
* The prevalence of specific trims within each model

Feel free to use the sorting and filtering options (if available) to refine your exploration and focus on specific aspects of the data.

**Key Data Points:**

* Make: Manufacturer of the car (e.g., Ford, Kia, Chevrolet)
* Model: Specific car model (e.g., Sorento, F-150, Camry)
* Seller: The entity selling the car (e.g., Kia Motors America Inc, Enterprise Vehicle Exchange)
* Trim: A designation within a model that indicates specific features or options (e.g., LX, EX, XLE)
